# Ball-and-Chain
Small C# Unity game

The goal is to maneuver two linked balls (blue and red) through a maze from the start position to the goal position.
While the blue ball is smaller, the red ball can pass through blue walls.

Planned features:
- Red walls (only blue may pass through)
- Chain walls (chain between balls cannot pass over)
- Buttons (only red can trigger)
- Menu and level select
